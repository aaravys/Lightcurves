# Lightcurves
**What is this script about?** This script is regarding the SETI. This script can plot lightcurves, so that we can track abnormalities in the light curve to potentially identify exoplanets(potential homes to ETs).

**What is this script for myself and others in the future?** This script will help us to identify exoplanets based on abnormalities in a star's light curve. This script is helpful for an aspiring SETI astrophysicist. Exoplanets can be studied and we can measure the ability for them to support life. We could even identify life on exoplanets that have been discovered.

**The TESS satellite used to capture these lightcurves** The TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) is a space telescope designed for searching for exoplanets using the transit method(which detects when a planet passes in front of its star. It has found 66 confirmed exoplanets. According to harvard.edu, "TESS surveys the entire sky using four cameras, which together collect light from stars in successive swaths 24 degrees wide by 90 degrees long. These cameras work in two modes, capturing 2-minute exposures of the 200,000 brightest stars in the sky and 30-minute exposures of every visible star".It is a brilliant piece of engineering.
